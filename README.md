# SIFT-and-Hough-Transform
SIFT corner detector and Hough line detector
Implementation of SIFT and Hough transform algorithms using Python. 

SIFT is an algorithm used to detect and describe local features in digital images. 
It locates certain key points and then furnishes them with quantitative information which can for example be used for object recognition. 
The descriptors are supposed to be invariant against various transformations which might make images look different although 
they represent the same object(s).

For Hough Transform, two points (x y) and(z k) define a line in the (x y) Two points (x,y) and(z,k) define a line in the (x,y)
plane.These two points give rise to two different lines in (a,b) space. In (a,b) space these lines will intersect in a point 
(a’,b’) where a’ is the rise and b’ the intersect of the line defined by (x,y) and (z,k) in (x,y) space.
